        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          Unique user hash to correlate information for a user in anonymized form.
        note: >
          Useful if `user.authentication.id` or `user.name` contain confidential information and cannot be used.

      - id: user.id
        type: string
        stability: experimental
        brief: >
          Identifies a user interacting with a system regardless of user authentication status. This identifier may be unique only through best-effort means.
        note: >
          The `user.id`, when populated, is expected to be generated before user is authenticated and SHOULD NOT change after the user logs in.
          In browser scenarios `user.id` is usually stored in cookies.

          It's NOT RECOMMENDED to populate this attribute when unauthenticated users are not tracked or identified by the system.

          It can be a random guid or a hash of the user's IP address. This is different from `user.hash` which is a hash of a known `user.id` or `user.name`.

      - id: user.authentication.id
        type: string
        brief: Unique identifier of an authenticated user in the system.
        note: >
          The `user.authentication.id` MAY be used to identify a user attempting to authenticate if it's known at this stage.
